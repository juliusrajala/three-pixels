# Three Pixels

This is an extremely simple sass project that simply displays the three color choises for google's 2016 pixel phones. It's nothing exciting or terribly useful.

I did include babel etc. for possible future implementation of some functionality like fetching the lowest price of the phone or whatever.

Yeah. You need something to do while you watch shitty movies from Netflix.

## Usage

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
### Running it
```
npm start //Build and start http-server
npm run dev //Nodemon process for watching file changes and http-server
```
